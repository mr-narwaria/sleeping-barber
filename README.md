# Sleeping Barber Problem

## Problem Statement:

The multiple-sleeping barber problem is a classical synchronization problem that 
models a scenario where multiple barbers work at a barbershop with limited chairs 
for waiting for customers. The problem is as follows:
There is a barbershop with M chairs for waiting for customers and N barbers who cut 
hair. When a customer enters the barbershop, if there is an available barber, the 
customer sits in the barber's chair and gets a haircut. If there is no available barber, the 
customer sits in one of the M chairs to wait for a barber to become available. If all 
chairs are occupied when a new customer arrives; the customer leaves and does not 
get a haircut.

## Solution:

There are several possible solutions, but all solutions require a mutex, which ensures 
that only one of the participants can change state at once.Implement the answer like 
that the barber must acquire the room status mutex before checking for customers and 
release it when they begin to sleep or cut hair. Customers must acquire it before 
entering the shop and release it when they sit in a waiting room or barber chair and 
leave the shop because no seats are available. This would take care of both problems
mentioned above.
This means when a barber thread wakes up, they will try to acquire the mutex and 
check if there is any customer waiting. If there is no customer waiting, they will release 
the mutex and go back to sleep. Otherwise, they will remove the customer from the 
queue, update the number of waiting for customers, and start cutting their hair. Once 
they are done, they will release the mutex and return to sleep.


## How to program run?

This multi-threaded program simulates a barbershop with multiple barbers and 
customers. The program uses the pthread library to create and manage threads.
The program defines three global variables: maxcustomer, maxbarber, and sizequeue. 
These variables specify the maximum number of customers, barbers, and the size of 
the waiting room.

The program defines two functions, barber and customer which represent the barber 
and customer threads 

## Barber function

The barber function takes a pointer to an integer argument representing the barber ID. 
The function enters an infinite loop and locks the mutex mtx. It then waits on the 
conditional variable cuscondition while the waitroom queue is empty. When the queue 
is not empty, the barber pops the first customer ID from the waitroom queue, 
decrements the waitcustomer count, and releases the mutex.

## Customer function

The customer function takes a pointer to an integer argument representing the 
customer ID. The function locks the mutex mtx and checks if the waiting room is full, 
the function prints a message that the customer is leaving and exits the function. 
Otherwise, the function pushes the customer ID onto the waitroom queue, increments 
the waitcustomer count, and signals the cuscondition variable. The function then 
releases the mutex and exits.
